Title: Quantile Normalization of Single-cell RNA-seq Read Counts Without UMIs
Version: 0.1.0
Description: Converts single-cell RNA-seq read counts lacking unique molecular 
    identifiers (UMIs) into "quasi-UMIs" which can be analyzed as if they were
    real UMI counts. The goal of this normalization is to remove distortions 
    due to PCR amplification.
